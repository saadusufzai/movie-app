Hello there!

by submitting this project I want to let you guys know that this was a really fun project and I enjoyed it a lot.
Unfortunately my schedule was really busy and I only had the weekend to complete the task.
Ive tried my best to do justice with the project. There was a lot of thing in design and performance of the app that could have been done but lack of time was the main issue here.
I hope you guys like it and if you have any suggestions or feedback please let me know.

About the App: The App contains total three pages/routes: 
- Home
- details
- Stats

user can sort the movies by clicking the sort button, the movies by default comes sorted as 10-0 by rating .
user can search any movie in the search bar and new movies will replace the old ones on the home page.
user can not sort the searched movies only.
user can go to the details page by hovering and clicking on the detail button on each move tile.

detail page : 
user can see the details of the movie and similar movies.
user can rate the movie from 1 to 10 and the rating will be sent to tmdb. A guest session id will be generated and a POST request will be sent.(I have not resigned any action for this event)
user can click on the movies below to see the details

stats:
stats page contain two d3 graphs
- first graph shows the top 10 movies by rating
- second graph shows the top 10 movies by vote count


Note: The Home page and Details page is fully responsive but unfortunately the stats page is not fully responsive and it was because of the reason mentioned above.
